# Exploratory Data Analysis and Modeling of Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Classification Algorithms 

The project included an exploratory data analysis and evaluation of binary classification algorithms using Python sci-kit learn Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classification, Gradient Boosting Classification, Support Vector Machine Classifier, and KNN Classifier.  Model were trained and tested and test accuracy was compared to arrive at a final model.   

## Objective:
The objective of the project was to build a predictive model for Breast Cancer diagnosis.  

## Dataset source:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset/data

### Data Contents:
- The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and was referred to as the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
  - Unique ID:  Unique incidence of data.
  - Diagnosis: Indicates whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B). This is the target variable, used to classify the tumor type based on other features.
  - Radius Mean:  The average distance from the center to the perimeter of the tumor lobes. A larger radius may indicate a more aggressive or irregular tumor.
  - Texture Mean:  The average variation in the grayscale intensity of the tumor's surface texture. This feature could relate to the heterogeneity of the tumor, with more variable textures potentially indicating malignancy.
  - Perimeter Mean:  The average measurement around the boundary of the tumor lobes. A larger perimeter could signify irregular or more invasive tumor growth.
  - Area Mean:  The average area covered by the tumor lobes. Larger areas may be associated with more advanced or invasive tumors.
  - Smoothness Mean:  The average measure of how smooth or regular the edges of the tumor are. Lower smoothness might suggest more irregular tumor boundaries, which could indicate malignancy.
  - Compactness Mean:  Calculated as the square of the perimeter divided by the area, it measures how tightly packed the tumor cells are. A higher compactness may indicate more aggressive tumor behavior.
  - Concavity Mean:  The average extent of concave (inward) regions along the tumor boundary. More concavity may suggest irregular, invasive tumor growth.
  - Concave Points Mean:  The average number of concave points on the tumor boundary. More concave points are often associated with more irregular tumor shapes, which could be an indicator of malignancy.
